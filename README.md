# 🧠 LLM Sprint: 45 Days to Genius

Welcome to my self-guided 45-day challenge to master Large Language Models (LLMs)!  
I'm learning and building in public — one day at a time.

## 🔥 Goal
To understand LLMs deeply and build real-world applications using them.

## 📅 Progress

| Day | Topic                               | Highlights                                  |
|-----|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Introduction to LLMs                | Basics, motivation, architecture overview   |
| 2   | Transformers & Attention            | Self-attention, positional encoding, demo   |
| 3   | Embeddings + Training Techniques    | Word embeddings, pretraining, fine-tuning   |
| 4   | Prompting + Finetuning              | Zero-shot, few-shot, CoT, GPT2 experiments  |
| 5   | Smart Text Generator App (Project)  | Built a configurable LLM prompt playground  |
| 6   | LLM Q&A App (Zero-Shot)             | Built a context-aware QA system using HF    |
| 7–10 | Deployment, Evaluation & Tuning 🔥   | ✅ [Live Demo App](https://simplechatbotaiforprogrammers.streamlit.app/) <br> Built Streamlit app using flan-t5-large, evaluated output, tuned decoding params, and deployed publicly |
