# 📘 Day 6 – LLM Question Answering App (Zero-Shot)

This is part of my **45-Day LLM Mastery Challenge**.  
Today, I built a simple and powerful **LLM-powered Question Answering App** using Hugging Face's transformers.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- What is **zero-shot Q&A** using pretrained transformer models
- How to format `context` and `question` for best results
- Basics of QA-specific models like `distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad`

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Google Colab
- Pretrained model: `distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad`

## 🔍 Demo Use Case

**Context:**
> LLMs are trained on vast corpora and can perform translation, summarization, and question answering...

**Question:**
> What are LLMs used for?

**Model Answer:**
> translation, summarization, and question answering
